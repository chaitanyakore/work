1. You must have admin/  & admin.local/ at "Build Context Directory" .i.e. directory where Dockerfile File exists
2. Remove .snv folder from both, admin and admin.local (If you want to create an image)
2. Configure files available in config/ (Add Zabbix Server's IP in zabbix_agentd.conf )
3. Execute " docker build -t nameforimage.0 . " to create an image (The same image must be configured in .env file of docker-compose)
4. This will create an Image
5. This image is now available to accept paramters from docker-compose file
